# Odin-recipes
## Introduction
The Project: Recipes is a practice project during the HTML lesson in The Odin Project
Recipes is a simple website that is going to be built using only HTML and practice other tools like GIT and GITHUB, etc...

## Project: Recipes
This website will have a home page, and it will be linked to other recipes page
Home page: This is an index page that will link to other recipes page
Recipes Page: Which will have the respective recipes 

## Look Back: Updation after completing the project
I have added 3 recipes to the index page as per the instruction
  1. Madurai Bun Parotta
  2. Madurai Mutton Sukka
  3. Beef Bowl

### How to Add, Commit, Push in VSCode
I forgot to add and commit after each update, i did it at the end
Trick/Tip: In the VSCode we can do this easily
  1. Go to Source Control
  2. Click + icon on what you need to add
  3. Write the commit message and click commit
  4. and do the same for whole project
  5. To push, click ... button and click push

and after all i dont know to find the Git page to view my project, after few 10+ min, found on Reddit.
Go to settings -> Pages (On side bar) -> change none to main -> and search github-user-name.github.io/repo-name
