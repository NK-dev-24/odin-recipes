        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> The parottas of Madurai are legendary. They are a world apart from the parathas of the north and are different even from the Malabar parottas of our neighbouring state. Here, the flaky flatbreads are denser, richer and tastier. Ask any local foodie and they would recite the adaptation of a popular meme: “Parottas are an emotion.”</p>
        <p>The famous bun parotta of Madurai is a more recent invention, which is claimed by a local restaurant that shot to fame because of the dish. “One of our masters came up with it in 1999 by incorporating eggs, milk and sugar into the regular parotta recipe,” says K Karuppanan, proprietor of the Madurai Bun Parotta Kadai. The dough is then allowed to rise for four hours: this combined with the technique of tossing the flattened dough in the air until it is thin and supple gives the parotta a lusciously layered texture. The sweetness and the fluffiness are reminiscent of buns, hence the name.</p>
